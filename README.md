# Setup instructions

2. Install Dependencies:

3. Run app

# Architectutal overview
1. React's Context API is used for managing state across the app
2. React Router is used to the routing
3. Three pages are implemented one each for the Table, the Chart and the input form

# Design Choices
1. React is the UI javascript framework of choice
2. TS is the language of choice
3. Context API is used since it is appropriate for this level of complexity as opposed to Redux which would be overkill

# Scope Cuts
1. UI Design and CSS Styling is minimalistic
2. Accessibility has not been tested
